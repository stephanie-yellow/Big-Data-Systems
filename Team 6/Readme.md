# State Farm Distracted Driver Testing
Brian Blancato, Brittny Hopwood, Stephanie Landas, Austin Rivera

# Problem
Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a driver is distracted, and if so, what type of distraction is affecting them. There are 10 possible options for the model:
1. Driving safely
2. Texting (right side of image)
3. Talking on the phone (right side of image)
4. Texting (left side of image)
5. Talking on the phone (left side of image)
6. Operating the radio
7. Drinking
8. Reaching behind
9. Doing hair and makeup
10. Talking to passenger

# Data. 
The data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/overview). The original dataset contains over 102 thousand images of drivers--some distracted, some not. To be able to run on local machines, a smaller subset of the data was used for model building and analysis.
