# State Farm Distracted Driver Testing  
Brian Blancato, Brittny Hopwood, Stephanie Landas, Austin Rivera

# The Goal
Create a model that can accurately predict the type of distracted driving based on images. 

# Data
The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/overview).  
It originally contains over 102,000 images of drivers-- some safely, some distracted-- split into a training and testing dataset. So we could run on local machines, a small subset of this data was used.
